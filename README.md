- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Josh170896
- I am currently in the process of self learning and attending online courses in order to improve my current analytical skills so that I am able to gain employment as a Data Analyst. I am currently enrolled onto the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This certificate will give me the skills to process and analyse data, use key analysis tools, and create visualisations that can inform key business decisions. I am on track to complete this certificate by January 2023. Alongside the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate I am improving on my knowledge of Microsoft Excel, SQL, Microsoft PowerBI,Tableau and Python.
